# **Bouncer** #
Bouncer is a MySQL backed plugin for Bukkit minecraft servers that provides three core features.

## Join/Leave throttling ##
On larger servers when you have players joining and leaving constantly, the constant spam of messages can be overwhelming. Bouncer allows you to throttle these messages so that if someone leaves and rejoins within X seconds, no message will display. 

This keeps the chat clean, and the users happy.. and we all know happy users are important.

## Custom join and leave messages ##
This plugin allows users to have custom join and leave messages to the server, giving users a bit of customizable flare when joining the server. For example: instead of the "Bob joined the server.", it could instead read "Bob has come for ALL THE DIAMONDS!"

In addition to the custom message, the first time a new player joins the server, he is given a custom message that stands out. Doing this allows other players to recognize a new player and give him a proper welcome and friendly advice on where to build or mine.

## IP and nickname access control ##
Acting as an alternative to the native minecraft ban control, Bouncer allows you to grant or deny access to your server based upon IP or Nickname. 

When it comes to denying users, bans can have a limited durration which allows you to temporarily ban users for a 15 minutes instead of the indefinite bans by default.
